# horiseon

Challenge week 1

The first thing I had to do when working on this challenge was to create a repository with a readme. I then cloned it. I worked on condensing the code in both the html and css by reducing the amount of divs. I did so by creating changing two of the divs into a header and footer. I then created a main and changed a bunch of the divisions in to sections
